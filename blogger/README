Couple of scripts to download Blogger posts and add to the database, as well as comments

REALLY hacked together:

- Only works in pretty specific database format
- Completely hand-waves over encoding issues
- No real way to do partial, or steps, mainly in one big go
- commandline spam, with no real options

Bottom line, try to avoid using Blogger in the first place if you ever plan to move away from it
